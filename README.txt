Project 3 - This is a basic favorite players list that a group of users could compile... Perhaps the groups allstar picks by sport. A user must create a sport and positions (this user becomes the sole manager of that sport and positions). Once at least one position exists for a sport, any logged in user may begin adding players. 

This project uses Python, the flask framework, and a SQLite database

Note to mimic my exact setup: install vagrant and virtual box - https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud088/vagrant

once vagrant and virtual box are installed

start vagrant
